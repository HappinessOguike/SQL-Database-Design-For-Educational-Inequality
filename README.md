# SQL-Database-Design-For-Educational-Inequality
**Built a database to compare Inequality in education**

Following the review of the completed questionnaire responses, the various information chunks 
were organized into tables and converted in a user-friendly manner for easy understanding. The 
goal was to get insight into the connections between the child's background, work, school, 
teachers, peer groups, and learning results.
To ensure data integrity, security, concurrency, and other factors that contribute to the system's overall efficacy, 
numerous database features were also implemented.
